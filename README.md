## Development

Running the application:

```shell
# first shell window
npm run start-webpack

# second shell window
npm run start-electron
```

> It is pretty ugly running in different windows. But we will improve it later.

Every change in the code will trigger the webpack to build the code. Use `Cmd+R` to reload the app.
